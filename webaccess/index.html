   <h2>Project 1: Web accessibility Evaulation</h2> 
   <p>Name: Sowmya Chandra</p>
   <p>IU Address: sowchan@iu.edu</p>
   <p>In this project we had to evaluate a robust, multi-page website on the basis of accessibility. We had to identify 3 accessibility problems using a web accessibility tool. For my project, I used the <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" >WAVE tool. </a> With that, we had to list the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion that was violated, with a brief description. After that,we had to come up with recommended accessibility improvements, whether on the basis of code, design or content. We used the WAI template to report the suggestions. </p>
    <H3>Website Information</H3>
    <p>Name of website: LingCars <br>
        Purpose of site: To provide car leasing services in the UK. <br>
        Base URL of site: https://www.lingscars.com/ (Links to an external site.)</p>
        <h3> Problem #1: The contrast between the foreground and background colors is very low. </h3>
        <p> Problem Description: In some text and images, the color of the text doesn’t contrast enough,
            which makes it hard to read for people with low vision. Text is present that has a contrast ratio
            less than 4.5:1, or large text (larger than 18 point or 14 point bold) has a contrast ratio less than
            3:1. It’s also relevant for text with background images, where the color of the background should
            have enough contrast with the text.  <br>
            Problem Impact: Users with visual impairment would have difficulty reading text if it’s color is
            too close to the background. Readers often use contrast as a way to interpret the letters, with its
            shape visible
            </p>
            <h4>Relevant WCAG 2.1 Guidelines and Success Criteria:</h4>
            <p>1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA): Text and images of text have a contrast ratio of at least
                4.5:1.</p>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>To increase the contrast between text and background, through making
                the text color black(#000000) or a dark grey of #9E9E9E.</p>
            <xmp>            <p style="color: #9e9e9e;">terms and conditions</p>
            <p style="color: black;">Terms and conditions</p></xmp>



        <h3> Problem #2: Image doesn't have alternative text on website </h3>
        <p>Problem Description: In order to get pictures across to the screen reader, it should have
            alternative text. Some images on the screen do not have alternative text, and so if the user were
            to use screen reader, they wouldn’t be able to understand the text because it doesn’t have a
            description. <br>
            Problem Impact: Users with vision impairment who use screen readers would find it difficult to
            understand what the image is without alternative text in it. If the image isn’t available, it would
            be hard to interpret it. Thus, all images should have an alternate text attribute.</p>
    <h4>Relevant WCAG 2.1 Guidelines and Success Criteria:</h4>
    <p>1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A): Images, form image buttons, and image map hotspots have
        appropriate, equivalent alternative text.
        </p>
    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p>While inserting an image, insert the alternate attribute to the tag</p>
    <xmp>        <img src="img/nissan leaf.JPG.JPG" alt="Nissan Leaf">
        <img src="img/checker flag.JPG" alt="Checker Flag">
        <img src="img/lightning bolt.JPG" alt="lightning bolt">
    </xmp>

    <h3> Problem #3: Adjecent links go to the same URL. </h3>
        <p>
            problem description: Since adjecent links go to the same URL, it can re redundant for the user, especially someone who is using assistive technology like a screen reader.
            Problem Impact: Users who use assistive technologies like screen readers may feel confused.

        </p>

        <h4>WCAG 2.0 checkpoints and techniques-2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) (Level
            A)- </h4>
    <p>The purpose of each link (or form image button or image map hotspot) can be
        determined from the link text alone, or from the link text and its context (e.g.,
        surrounding text, list item, previous heading, or table headers).
        </p>

    <h4>solution</h4>
    <p> Solutions- to combine redundant links into one link and remove redundant links
        from the image.We should include an alternative text for the image.

<h3> Problem #4: One of the Elements of the website has a "Marquee" tool. </h3>  

<p>
    Problem Description: There is a Marquee element present on the website, which presents text
that scrolls across the page, out of the users control. Users cannot stop to read or evaluate the
text. It could also be a distracting factor to users, especially those with some cognitive
disabilities. The text scrolling is too fast, and with a lot of text that makes it hard to follow. <br>
Problem Impact: Users with cognitive disabilities would find it really hard to read and follow
this text. It could be very distracting to users, since it's always in motion. Since users are unable
to stop the text, they have to read quickly, which can be a hindrance to some.
</p>
<h4>Relevant WCAG 2.1 Guidelines and Success Criteria:</h4> 
<p>
    2.2.6 Timeouts(WCAG 2.1 Level AAA): Users must be warned of any timeout that could result
in data loss, unless the data is preserved for longer than 20 hours of user inactivity. <br>
2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide (Level A) : Automatically moving, blinking, or scrolling content (such
as carousels, marquees, or animations) that lasts longer than 5 seconds can be paused, stopped, or
hidden by the user.

</p>
<H4>Solution</H4>
<p>Replace marquee tool with standard HTML element and style it with CSS.</p>
<xmp><p>Leader of the Pack - The UK's favorite car leasing website! </p></xmp>
<p>Or add a stop and start button for the marquee</p><xmp>
            <marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left" scrollamount="10" id="marquee2"><p>Leader of the Pack - The UK's favorite car leasing website!</p></marquee>
            <input type="button" value="Stop Marquee 1" onClick="document.getElementById('marquee2').stop();"/>
            <input type="button" value="Start Marquee 1" onClick="document.getElementById('marquee2').start();"/><br /></xmp>
